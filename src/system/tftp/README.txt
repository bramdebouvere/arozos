    AROZOS TFTP SERVER ROOT DIRECTORY
==========================================

TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol) is a simple file transfer protocol.

IMPORTANT NOTES:
1. DO NOT upload files directly to this root directory
2. Navigate to the filesystem UUID subdirectories to access your files
3. TFTP does not support directory listing
4. TFTP is designed for small file transfers (max 32MB per file)
5. Files must be referenced by their full path including UUID

SECURITY NOTICE:
- TFTP has no built-in authentication
- Access is controlled via the configured default user
- User group permissions apply to all transfers
- Consider using SFTP or FTPS for sensitive data
